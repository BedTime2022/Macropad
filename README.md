on 6 of december,
I started designing the macropad, with the intent of making a 4 keys keyboard for ddr like games.

A oled display to show the keys being pressed for aesthethics but also i've been thinking about making it capable of showing information from api's (like media playing, weather, gif's, etc.)

after some thought I decided to add a "change" button to toggle between arrows and dfjk keys.

THANKS a lot to hackclub and amd for creating blueprint check it out at https://blueprint.hackclub.com/. ^^
